Coca Cola vending machine. The price is 1 leu. 5-, 10- and 50-bani coins are accepted. The system is equipped with 5 photocells:
F0- for the 5 bani coin;
F1- for the 10 bani coin;
F2- for the 50 bani coin;
F3- for rejecting currency (other than those accepted) or foreign bodies;
F4- for currency accepted signal.
If there is no Coca Cola then no coin type (FS) is accepted. The total amount is checked and the coins are returned if the amount is not complete (RM). Re-release the rest, if any.
Signals are generated and signaled for the acceptance of a coin (AM), the total (AT) and the release of Coca Cola.
